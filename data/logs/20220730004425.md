Continuing with the theme of putting experience above trail miles I took the treacherous forest road toward Callahan with Charlie, who I met at the junction. Along the final stretch of road just before the town containing a church, post office, and bar, a pickup truck with a camper painted like a cow veers across the road to pull into the opposite shoulder. A man jumps out asking if we are hikers and need a ride. A bit skeptical of the situation I say we're just walking till Callahan. He responds he's got three hikers in the truck who he's bringing to Etna. I wonder but don't ask if they are alive and go up front to investigate. Sure enough there are two hikers up front and another in the bed of the truck beneath the camper. So Charlie and I look at each other and decide to hop in for the ride. Yes men.

The back of the truck is hot. So hot that breathing is a challenge. But watching the map I know it's not more than 15 minutes until we reach Etna. Once in town though our driver figured it appropriate to give the two up front a full tour of town. So we spent the next few minutes boiling while the truck made k turn after k turn going up and down every street in town. Eventually we were let free in the parking lot of a distillery restaurant. Naturally craving real food the 5 of us went in for a nice meal and drinks. From there I went to the park where hikers are invited ti sleep and shower. There are already dozens of hikers here, a few of whom are old friends I'm excited to reunite with. After a few drinks and a shower I spend time setting up and catching up. It's well after midnight by the time I'm in bed. I expect tomorrow will be a slow day for me spent well in town.
