I just hiked 44 miles to complete the Pacific Crest Trail. Oddly enough I feel little. By the time I arrived the sun has already set. I placed my things down and sat against the monument for a few moments, sipping champagne ive carried for the occasion. Nothing. Now I'm laying on some uneven ground beneath a tree to avoid the inevitable morning condensation. Tomorrow I'll spend some more time in reflection. Im glad it's over. That is besides for the 30 miles I just now hike back to harts pass. One day shy of 4 months and the PCT is a part of my history. 

I've reached the monument. An arbitrary point along a continuing trail. But it's where their journey ends for me. A place meant to releave the tension of four months of efforts. A place with no value of its own but infinite value to others. I'll turn around now to walk back to civilization while this monument will continue to stand tall in memory. I thought the trail would bring clarity which it did but not in the ways I anticipated. It brought clarity in how to do whatever I do but said nothing about what it is I should do.

Arriving here just further validates the journey as the first priority. The monument frames the journey into a grand adventure which could be endless without it. However there's little the monument brings in terms of value that is even a close comparison to the many valuable lessons and experiences had along the way. Merely that, a monument, letting us know it's time to take this journey home. 

This place which previously lay in my distant future now lies in my past. For so many others it still needs to be conquered. This place sends 1000s each year on a pilgrimage unlike any other. A spiritual place.
