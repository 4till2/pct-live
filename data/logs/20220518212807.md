A sunny day beginning slowly with the convenient kindness of the Mesa Wind farm workers, full of big climbs, leading across streams, with breaks for bathing, more climbs, and our first night camping along the sands of flowing water. 

I had lots of time for thought today. Thoughts, which with the repetition of walking, and lack of distraction seem to follow themselves further. Often in a way reminiscent of childhood. Sometimes there are meaningful takeaways or new understandings but mostly there is just thought. Where the imagination flows freely and without judgment. Playful in nature and without conclusion. The most similar experience to this I can recall in my typical life is when behind the wheel after some time during a long drive. This, like so many aspects of this relativity short hike, is refreshing.
