Today each step was an above average effort. Three times I found myself off trail. The first just moments after starting the day, requiring a long tough scramble to rejoin. The others had less of a consequence yet were curiously out of character. I think I might just need some good sleep. Later in the day I stopped to rest beside a river and dozed off for a few minutes which helped. Coincidentally I learned 6 miles before my destination for the day that camping is prohibited for the following 10 miles. So rather than hike a 21 mile day I landed an early night.

It's a low day so this probably holds less crediability but I'm finding less and less inspiration from what should otherwise be awe inspiring. I spend more time thinking about where I'd like to be than being where I am.
