We woke early and packed up quickly to leave our campsite before the morning shift workers arrived to see us crawl from our sleeping bags. Immediately after grabbing a small but delicious breakfast at the coffee shop Benji and I head over to the Post Office not yet visited but allegedly holding our package. Frustratingly but unsurprisingly they claim to not have it since it had been sent over this morning to the branch we visited yesterday. Laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation we hopped on a bus back to were we began the day before. Confidently explaining to our friend behind the desk of the facts he kindly responded that it's not actually the case and the stand in attendant at the other branch had failed to properly look for our box merely dismissing his responsibilities by sending us back here. Throwing our hands in the air Benji and I went to sit on the curb to discuss what next. At first agitated we helped each other clear our perspectives and accept this as another step along the trail toward Canada. Just another challenge to embrace and overcome. The primary problem now is my shoes are worn down to their skeletal structure with rips, little padding or cushioning and at places even cloth. My feet have been hurting as a result of all this and I'd been counting on ditching these 600 mile shoes here. However after calling every outfitter in town and checking multiple websites it's become apparent the shoes being held hostage by the USPS were my only hopes of doing so. So we decided to return to the other post office and do whatever it took, plead or stink, until the shoes were found. Upon returning the line had grown out the door, unreasonably long for a single worker. But we waited. Eventually reaching the desk I just barely opened my mouth to present my case when he cut me off saying he'll go check again. Minutes later he returned empty handed but with some good news. Someone is back there looking for it he says followed by an emotionless "next".

Out from the back came another worker with some questions about the package. We show him all of the information available to us and to our suprise he asks for affirmation that the information provided by the usps is indeed correct. We tell him as far as we can tell it is as and he heads back to search. Twice he returns with boxes addressed to unfamiliar names to confirm that we got the naming correct. This goes on for over an hour. Bored I begin walking around the lobby peeking through cracks in the P.O. Boxes at the back of house. An employee loading mail into these boxes asks if he can help with something so I tell him I'm just curious while waiting on them to find my shoes. From here we begin chatting about the trail and he shares his views on the burn zone which Benji and I are currently deciding what to do about. We chat for a bit before he says he'd go help look for the shoes himeself but he can't leave the mail boxes unlocked and unattended. But he says one moment and shouts toward his coworker to help me. She responds that the other employee is already looking for it and not to bother her. I laugh. Then eureka he truly was looking for it since I hear him shout "I found it" from behind the boxes. He comes into view smile as big as can be, package in hand. It takes a few more moments of chatting with his coworker before finally delivering the shoes with pride. I immediately open the box to get the old shoes off and new shoes on my feet. As I'm throwing out the garbage Benji is taking pictures of what might be the most exciting change of shoes in my lifetime. Noticing that I'm throwing out the trash the postal worker loading mail asks what I intend to do with my old shoes. Toss them out of course I respond, they are just barely a viable shoe at this point. Can I have them he asks. Taken back I try to explain what's visibly obvious but he interjects that shoes are shoes and he'll make 'em work or donate them. With nothing to loose and an appreciation for his enthusiasm to recycle I gladly hand him the shoes and ask for him to send me a pic of where they end up.

Having had enough of the Post Office for a long while Benji and I head out for some lunch. Pizza has been on my mind so we stop at the New York Style Pizza shop. Together we eat nearly a full cicilian pie, knocking us into a deep food coma. The joys of eating are far greater on trail. In fact nearly all joys are heightened on trail. But eating lots always seems like the right thing to do when considering the caloric deficit we are constantly battling. Finally we get up from our seats to head back to trail. On the way to the highway for a hitch I stop into a music store to inquire about a harmonica. Without even sitting up from his position sprawled across a couch the sales rep says no. 

We waited at the on-ramp for nearly an hour roasting under the sun as hundreds of cars passed us by. It's a vulnerable position to rely on others for transportation to and from trail. Most drivers look for a few seconds trying to make sense of the un-familiarity of the circumstances, but it all happens so quick that unless giving a ride was already in their plans it's unlikely it will get there. Frustrated and without options I sit down hoping that the one who does have it in their plans will be understanding of my lack of thumb. Then from across the street comes a man with a notebook offering to drive us to where we need to go so long as we can get him the cash from an atm for which he'll PayPal us. Dean continues to explain that he lost his wallet and his car is broken requiring more gas even though it already has enough. We agree and begin the long walk up the road toward his car doing the exchange along the way. After 15 minutes of walking we agree to wait back at the Safeway to be picked up after he takes care of his car. While waiting Benji and I stop into a gear shop to exchange my Darn Toughs. The lady there being either overly friendly or drunk is happy to help. 
So how does this work I ask. Do you have to send a box of dirty socks back and get refunded by Darn Tough? Yeah exactly she responds as Benji comes by and asks the same question receiving the same response. Then she tosses the socks in my direction proclaiming that'll be 0 dollars as the socks land with a thud on the floor beside me. Want me to throw you my dirty old ones I ask jokingly. I don't need em she responds. I like to keep old gear around so I'd keep them if I were you. But didn't you just say ... never mind, thanks for the help. Yeah no problem. If you need to fill up your water bottle you can she repeats for the third time since arriving. I'm alright but thank you again I respond as we head to Safeway.

In Safeway I bought a dozen donuts thinking I'd do some trail magic at the trail head. When Dean comes back around we hop in and the car stalls. It will stall another 16 times in the eight miles we drive back to trail. He says it took four days to get back from Reno, a trip that should take no longer than a couple of hours, with traffic. The damn car thinks it has no gas he claims. Then continues to explain how his other car was taken by the cops but even after sending it airborn over the center way of a highway it had no problems. Frustrated with the continued stalling as three lanes of cars and semis pass us by he exclaims he's got better things to be doing like gambling and screwing. Finally arriving at the trail head I offer him a donut and he offers his property to camp on anytime we need. We exchange thank you's and head our respective ways.

There is only one hiker at the trail head and it's Minivan. I'm glad to see him again, it's been a long while. He happily accepts a donut and the three of us head back on trail. Still holding a large box of donuts I can't find an ideal spot to leave them so I decide to hike them out. I figure I'll find enough hikers to be left with just the box by nightfall. When we get to the top of the 4 mile climb I'm still carrying the majority of the donuts. I've had worse. Our campsite atop the cliff has a beautiful sunset and enough wind to reduce the mosquitoes to just bearable conditions. After eating another I place the donuts in a tree with the rest of my food and set up camp on a flat rock. Today has been absolutely weird. I'm glad to be back on trail.
