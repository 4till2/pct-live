I've reached the monument. An arbitrary point along a continuing trail. It's where this journey ends for me. A place with little value of its own but infinite value to others. A frame for so many journeys. This place which previously lay in my distant future now lies in my past. For so many others it still needs to be conquered. This place sends 1000s each year on a pilgrimage. A spiritual place. I'll turn around now to walk back to civilization while this stone monument will continue to stand proud in memory.  It's time to take this journey home. 

As I arrive back at Harts Pass I learn that the fires have forced the trail behind me closed. I'm overcome with feelings of relief from months of tension. I'm emotional, but don't yet know it. All around me are people processing the completion of their hike. Some have made it to the border, others won't be able to due to fires. For those who can not the abrupt completion is a shock. Ironically so is it for those of us who have. It's easy to forget that we signed up for an arbitrary goal, done not out of necessity, but choice. A choice to embark on a journey north, for reasons personal to each. The border monument merely a "period" to that story. Permission to go home. A stone monument in the middle of the woods invites us to acknowledge the absurdity of it all. Hiking an arbitrary 2650 miles to arrive at an arbitrary boundary between arbitrary countries protecting arbitrary laws, values, and ideals. A realm of fiction. This isn't a critique but an acknowledgment. With this comes liberation. Liberty to draft one's own narrative. Choose the setting, tone, cast, plot line, and challenges. The trail teaches what is real and what isn't. The monument stands and testifies to that.

Hiking The Pacific Crest Trail has been the greatest endeavor of my life. A teacher unlike any other. Pushing my body and mind past unknown limits. Along the way forming deep bonds with others, and new understandings of myself. Enlightening me to some of the inner workings of nature. Intimately demonstrating the realities of climate change. Exposing human kindness, ingenuity, passion, and ability. A massively holistic experience.


*Writing this last entry from the comfort of a friends kitchen back in New Jersey is bringing up feelings of nostalgia. It's been less than two weeks since completion, and already it's feeling like a part of my distant past. I expected that to take more time. Demonstrating once again the foolishness in expectations. Who knows where the adventure will take me next but one thing is for certain, it doesn't end here.*
