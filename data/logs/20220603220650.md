The day was slow in pace which I enjoyed, yet filled with raw excitement. In the morning I took 2.5 liters of water from the spring a mile in with the intention of hiking less miles, stopping at one of the few potential water sources up ahead. A few miles later some new foot pain creeped up, so already feeling pretty tired I took an early siesta. 3 hours later I dragged myself back to consciousnes.

Though I typically carry 1 liter per 5 miles of walking today I found myself with 2 liters for 25.  Luckily the day was cool and not too strenuous but nonetheless I can feel dehydration kicking in. The first two water sources turned out to be no good, the first a tank smelling of skunk, and the second to deep to reach and full of garbage either way. Knowing I'd only get more dehydrated over night I pushed past my intended stopping point in pursuit of water. So as the sun set I walked forward 6 miles to a water cache thats allegedly never been empty. It was empty. Exhausted and dehydrated I set up camp for the night hopeful that the next cache a mile further would contain water. Otherwise it's 7 miles further to Hiker Town. I'll make it, though quite thirsty.

Living so close to survival is new for me. Its helping shift other concerns into perspective in a way previously only hypothetical. Furthermore throughout the day I've been texting with a friend about plans for spending tomorrow together. Having access to a cell phone with service, a wildly complex technology, while actively struggling to find water, a most primitive need, is a weird juxtaposition.

Oh and in a hurry I passed mile marker 500 bringing me to about 1/5 of the way to Canada! Rad.
