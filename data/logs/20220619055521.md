Im tired. Physically and mentally. Yesterday put a real demand on my body and in the sub freezing temperatures sleep didn't come easy. Maybe I'll take an extra day in Bishop, especially considering the effort it will take to get there. On todays itenerary is Forester Pass, the highest point on the PCT, followed by an off trail Kearsage Pass to hitch into Bishop. Once in the high Sierra backcountry the only way to town is via long and often arduous side trails. It brings an entire new meaning to the word remote.

Im listening to Zen and Now: On the Trail of Robert Pirsig and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It brings back fond memories and anecdotes from my own reading of the original. Like Zen and The Art, Zen and Now is written in a curious manner exploring the authors relationship with ideals through his experiences traveling. I feel as if I too am exploring my ideals through this grand hike.

The book reaches the prologue just as I reach the parking lot at Onion Valley. Within moments of positioning myself at the exit point preparing for a hitch a man pulls up and gets out of the car to help me with my bag. I had noticed him as I descended preparing to depart and remember him glancing back and noticing me. When I tell him I'm heading north to Bishop he responds he's going south toward Lone Pine but can drop me at the first neutral junction of Independence. It would be easier to hitch from the main road. I kindly refuse the offer stating I'd give this parking lot a fair chance. After all there are still plenty of cars here, each with a 50/50 chance of heading north. Unoffended he gets back in his car and drives away. Almost immediately I realize my mistake. There's no movement in the lot or in the surrounding hills. It's getting late and I'm all out of food. Better to have gotten into Indepence where there's at least the opportunity for eating and lodging. Why had I said no. It's the hopeful wishing for something better wasn't it. In refusing the ride I had fought life's flow. Had I learned nothing from the lessons on Zen? Or at least from prior experiences? Quickly catching myself feeling sorry I divert my attention to acting more Zen like now. Forgiving the recent past I look around and acknowledge the circumstances. For the first time I notice a majestic waterfall behind me, crashing fresh snow melt into the river below. The temperature is mild and sitting behind the shade of my pack I remind myself that of all places to be "stranded" this must be the most beautiful. A few moments later I see Brightside and Alchemist walking through the lot. This comes as a surprise as they had been ahead of me all day and I figured they must have gotten to town already. I shout after them. On the third attempt they turn around and look equally suprised to see me. How did you get here they ask. We've been waiting at the trail head for at least an hour. It turns out the trail splits a few feet before the end lending two ways to the lot. They go to tell the others to join me at the lots exit point. It's good to find their company. We agree that we'll all take the first ride to Independence and work our way from there to Bishop. I go for another walk through the lot seeking someone loading into their car and find a group of day hikers from Las Vegas eager to drive two of us to Independence. McMansion and I hop in.

From Independence the way to Bishop turns out to be more difficult than anticipated but with access to a convience store with fresh food, and the company of friends, I'm not worried. Soon enough though Alchemist flags down a guy from Trukee on his way back from San Diego. Alchemist, Anna, and I take the ride arriving in Bishop soon before sunset. It's good to have arrived. There's something else about walking 100 miles up and over thousands of feet of mountain to arrive in one's desired destination. After checking in to the Hostel California we go for some Mexican food. By the end of the hour we're all together again after Brightside and Prarie Dog finally arrive from their hitch. It's good spirits all around well past our usual bedtime of three stars. Tomorrow is for chores and rest. I'm still uncertain if I'll return to trail then or the day after.
