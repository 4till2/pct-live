A 300 acre fire in Seid Valley last night turned into one of more than 30000 acres by midday today. This means the trail between Etna and Ashland Oregon is closed, with those hikers already on trail being evacuated. As is typically the case with unanticipated circumstances, panic spread as quickly as the fire which had caused it. Oddly I heard no discussion about the situation from the perspective of the people living, and working within the fire zone, rather it was all chatter about how to get around it and the inconvenience of not being able to hike across the border. I understand the frustration but it's uncomfortable to observe how unconcerned most were beyond they're own selfish objectives. But the source must be in our immense focus which I do appreciate. Anyway with more and more hikers coming into town I began to feel overwhelmed despite the joy in catching up with so many old trail friends. When someone asked if I'd like a ride with them around the fire I jumped at the opportunity to get on trail a bit ahead of the bubble.

I was dropped off at the Callahan Lodge and Restaurant where I charged up, rested, and ate. Outside the sky began to turn red from the fire and ash rain fell. Uncertain of where to camp for the night I decided to make a decision after dinner. After I took a small walk around the lodge. When I returned to the lobby a stranger asked if I needed to go anywhere, inviting me to stay at his house back in California. I decided I'd prefer to get on trail so I can get an early start. So he dropped me a mile down the road where the trail picked up.

Not one day has gone by on trail where I haven’t felt intimately the harsh implications of Californias extended droughts and wildfires. Today I crossed the border into Oregon by car. A massive milestone done awkwardly. Yet while slightly anticlimactic for having come 1600 miles, it has me thinking of the many who’s lives are directly impacted by these all to frequent circumstances. The families leaving their homes uncertain of their future. The firefighters risking their lives to save those of others. I continue to hike not with indifference to these facts but inspiration from them. Hiking can at times feel like a purely selfish act yet I’m committed to make it otherwise.  From recognizing the kindness bestowed upon strangers by strangers, to a newfound respect for Mother Nature’s incredible ways, this trail continues to teach me integral lessons about humanity, and the ecosystem we reside in. So here’s a humble thank you to the magic that’s gotten me this far. Let’s keep this going!
