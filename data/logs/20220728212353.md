Getting back up the hill to return to the PCT after parting ways with Benji was a massive struggle. Benji returns to his new journey as I continue with mine. It was nice to have him a part of the hike for some time. Maybe it will help bridge the gap between this world and home. The terrain is uneasy today, and the heat is not helping. Mid day I'm rewarded with a swim in a warm glacier lake. I'm calling it relatively early today leaving just 63 miles to the next town. I'll try to get up early for a big day tomorrow.
