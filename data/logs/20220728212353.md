Getting back up the hill to return to the PCT after parting ways with Benji was a massive struggle. 

Benji returns to his new journey as I continue in mine. It was nice to have him a part of the hike for some time. Maybe it will help bridge the gap between this world and home. 

Super hot and uneasy terrain. The reward being a swim in a warm glacier lake. Im calling it relatively early today leaving just 63 miles to the next town. I'll try to get up early for a big day tomorrow.
