Our first day in the sierras began beside a creek. Though most of the miles where hot and dry the water carries are diminishing as we ascend. Trees are increasing in frequency as is the jagged rock formations. I've been hiking with Prarie Dog, Brightside, Alchemist, and Boogie the past few days and having a great time with it. Lots of laughs, games, and good conversation. 

For our siesta we rested beside a wide stream where the forest turns to meadow. Laying in the tall grass birds danced around us before a backdrop of distant mountains. It was perfect.

On the long walk up toward camp I removed my bear can from my pack to carry it by hand rather than in my pack. It works well at least for the period of time that it's full and introducing extra strain on my back. Other hikers got a real kick from the sight of me balancing a bear can in one hand as I go by. Upside is the upper body workout.

First night camping in the trees proper and im thrilled. After arriving at camp we stretched, ate dinner, smoked some weed, drew on Boogies mat, and I read some of The Alchemist out loud. Its already colder and we have a bit higher to climb. Tomorrow's hiking should be tough but beautiful.
