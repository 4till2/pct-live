It feels good to be back on trial. Mentally that is. Physically it's a challenge to bring the body back into gear. We only could get a ride back to trail at 1pm leaving the morning to Big Bear. Unfortunately I seemed to have left my Garmin watch there. Not the way I intended to lighten my load. 

I camp beside a river with a natural pool allowing for a late evening swim.
