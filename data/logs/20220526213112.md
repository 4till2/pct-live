My strength is back and the pain is well under control. Good thing too since the day is hot and with little shade. It appears the knee brace is helping on the downhills, as is paying far more attention to how I step.

Evident in the increased frequency I have earbuds in, the repetitive nature of hiking is becoming more obvious. Days are blurring in ways the first few didn't. It has me contemplating time and relativity. 

I anticipated it would be easier to listen to audiobooks than it has been. Oddly I'm finding it challenging to give them enough attention to be worth my while. Maybe once out of the desert and the heat lets up. In the meantime music has been great at picking up where the calories leave off.
