An unplanned zero accepted during the mid day heat at the laundromat. Even after taking late checkout we had to rush to clear our room. Knowing that Benj had his call at 10:30 meant late wake up for all of us and I took the chance to catch up on journaling during his call. After Benji, Steven, Bougie, and I packed up and head toward downtown for food. It was near noon by the time we sat down at the same restaurant Benji and I had enjoyed last night with Jeff and Ann. Sometime during our meal Crumbles joined for the company. Again we enjoyed the food and conversation leading well into the afternoon. At some point it was learned that Benji had spent time in the town in Alaska that our waitress grew up, leading to a great discussion and invitation by her for any of us to visit sometime when she returns. Immensely full we stopped into the gear store, for me to exchang socks before laundry. The next 2 hours we spent between the laundromat and shopping at the health food store across the street. When laundry finished we head over to the motel room Crumbles had reserved. Inside the ten by ten room was a queen size bed and just enough floor space surrounding to fit three sleeping pads. I'm truly exhausted nearly all the time now and appreciate the opportunity to do nothing. This and the dent this town has already made in my wallet were enough to convince me to withhold from going out for dinner. Once I settled in I didn't leave the room for the rest of the evening, eventually falling asleep at the foot of the bed.
