The wind last night kept me up much of the night. 

Last night while flossing a tooth filing came out. Will need to get it filled in Ridgecrest since it's the last city before Tahoe. I would have gotten in on Friday evening but will not slow down to get there Sunday, stay the night and hopefully get an appointment Monday morning. The potential upside to this is hopefully meeting back with the team on Monday. Ill enjoy the low mileage days though from a time perspective I'm not thrilled to fall 3 days back. 

Hiking in sandals is good. Only one blister from rocks. If they had mesh theyd be perfect. 

Shortest day since the beginning.
