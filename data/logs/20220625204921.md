Trail legs have landed. In no way did walking begin easy today yet it felt more natural than previously. I noticed something was different when I kept passing people yet had not had to pause to let another by. Toward the end of the day the walking actually did become easy even as I began the ascent toward Muir Pass after having already summited Mather Pass. It's a good feeling. There's little in my life that I have dedicated so much consistent effort towards as this hike. Watching the progression of my body and mind with the occasional breakthrough such as todays is a strong reminder of the compounding consequences of consistent effort over time. Much like the holes seen bored through rocks from years of dripping water. In my otherwise fast paced life I hope to intergrate this previously hypothetical idea as one now realized for myself.
