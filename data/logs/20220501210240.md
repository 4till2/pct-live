A day of final preparations for the trail with the boys. We run a few leisurely errands gathering food, a better knife, and another failed attempt for better pants. In a dirt parking lot I pack my final bag and we're off to my first stop along the trail. Scout and Frodos "hiker home". After introductions, a nice dinner, some lessons from Scout, and fewer than anticipated gear conversations, all 20 or so hikers besides Rascal and myself have turn in in anticipation of 5:30 wake up. A few minutes later and we too retire to our places under the tree. At first it seems I may have forgotten to repack my pillow but upon accepting the inconvenience I recall having stuffed it somewhere even now I can not recall. Nerves are calm. I'm ready.
