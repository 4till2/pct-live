Again began zero day 2 slowly without any agenda. Most of the time spent lounging around the Airbnb's kitchen, hot tub, and living room, listening to music and drinking beers. On days off like this the community becomes ever more present. Be it cooking, shopping, or caring for wounds, the sense of comradery is real. Dmitry joining that briefly is special.
