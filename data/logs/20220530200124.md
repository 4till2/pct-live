Early I completed the road walk around the endangered species trail closure. Once back on trail the grade was relatively easy with the majority of the day a mild decline, except for the 5 mile summit of Pacifico Mountain. At the top the foliage and surrounding views where magnificent, bringing me to a slower pace. Tonight I'm camping a tad earlier than typical in preparation for tomorrow's 26 mile water carry into Acton.
