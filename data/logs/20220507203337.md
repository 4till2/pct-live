Today was a zero. We awoke late in the back of Becky's yard and took our time to get ready for the day. During this unusual morning lull Lisa and I had a nice chat about the personal impact of an extended hiking trip, while polishing some cold leftover pizza.

In town I bought a new pair of shoes to provide more space for my feet to move, hopefully to reduce the blisters. After walking around in them all day I can feel a clear difffernece there but am concerned about the zero drop (lack of support).

I thought I would get more rest than I ended up giving myself. After free pie from Mommas, and the PCT sandwich special next door, I walked through town taking care of chores such as mailing home my old shoes, buying groceries, and charging my electronics. It continues to blow my mind how kind people are to hikers both on and off trail. When mentioning this to the girls working behind the counter of a mercantile they said people in Julian love and respect the hikers. We've got to be the worlds most loved bums. 

In town I met a woman and her three kids aged 13, 16, and 18, from Roslyn Canada, who are hiking the PCT together. They clearly where somewhat new to this but highly committed and enthused. Im rooting for them!

After a full day of town activities we got a ride back to Scissors Crossing with Ghost. There we slept, each within a different collection of trees hoping for some protection from the strong winds that blew through the night.
