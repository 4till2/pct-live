Today I want less to walk than I do to arrive. But my head is free and thoughts clear. Up ahead is Paradise Valley Cafe. Aptly named when you haven't had a fresh meal in a few days. The Airbnb with Oceans 11 is a great time. So nice to be lounging around freshly showered in chairs and couches under the protection of a permanent roof. We have pizza, beers, games, and cake to celebrate Dunkirks birthday and our efforts. A good day.
