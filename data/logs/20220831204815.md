I received my first congratulatory remarks from a passing day hiker. To think that there are just a few hours until I reach the end of this insane experiment.  Coincidentally our camp site tonight lies 42 miles short of the northern terminus. Tomorrow beginning at 3:30 am, Two Tone and I will push those 42 remaining miles to the monument. My body hurts exactly how I'd expect it to after 120 days of hiking but nothing could be worse than what I've already been through. It's weird to reflect back to the second day on trail when I hiked 14 difficult miles and doubted how I'd ever make it the next 2630. Now I'm sleeping a mere 42 miles from the end and once again will challenge my mind and body to its fullest. It's hard to say which challenge is greater but at least now I'm certain I have the grit. Months of effort are culminating in this last challenge. I feel good about leaving trail. It took some reflection and conversation to reach this point but I find the experience to be more integrated as a part of my core experience rather than a separate one. Soon this will all be in memory. Few will understand what we've been through but it won't matter much. It's who I've become and how I've personally developed that matters. My new and affirmed perspectives. Confidence. Awe. Friendships. Abilities. Understanding.
