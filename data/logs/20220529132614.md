I saw double trail magic today. First from Tiger Blood who was filling in a gap from her 2020 hike. After summiting Mount Baden Powell together she gifted me a bag of food. Then again later down trail a local couple, Chris and Paco, parked in the lot with a table spread with fresh fruit, snacks, drinks, and more. They were super sweet and eager for us hikers to enjoy the much appreciated delicacies. 

I've yet to be in a more aptly named place than today's Windy Gap. Each time the trail traversed the north side of the mountain I battled winds strong enough to blow me off trail. And as is the spirit of the PCT the day was filled with repetitive summits and descents.
