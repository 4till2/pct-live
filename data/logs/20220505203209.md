Today began at mile 42 and finished at mile 60. My longest hike, ever, by a long shot. I set up my tent for the first time and am very happy with it. So far the gear has been great for me. The trail has become familiar and my bags weight background pain. Its only the blister on my left heel that slows me now. Again I caught up with the og crew and got a big welcome. I really like these guys and will try to stick with 'em. Another good day that I will have to journal tomorrow.
