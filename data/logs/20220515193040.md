Stupid amounts of elevation. Somewhere around 5000 feet of change total. Only ever to decline to give chance for another incline. Oh and lots of games of sumbersaults over, and limbo under trees fallen across trail. But the pains where redeemed for views rarely seen. From the peaks of these mountains one could see the peaks just previously conquered and far beyond. After another night camping alone I'm glad to have rejoined with Oceans 11. Together we watched the lunar eclipse paint the moon red above a sparkling Palm Springs.
