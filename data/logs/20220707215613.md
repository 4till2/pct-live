Well I found them. Just two miles into the day I found Big Chills still at camp. The day went by very differently than the past few weeks. Far easier to get distracted in conversation and be freed of the burden of decision. Then we got some awesome trail magic of Costco hot dogs, snacks, and cold drinks. Around mile 25 my feet were really hurting and I had to slow down arriving in camp a bit after everyone else. Over all its good to be back with friends with more perspective on hiking solo. Oh and I set a new record by hiking 33 miles. Though not without feeling it. The plan is to do 30 tomorrow into Tahoe yet im not sure if I will feel good enough to do what's not necessary. Sleep.
