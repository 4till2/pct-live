In theory a short day but in reality super long. The weather is warming up again as we go north, as the water becoms more sparse. Following the ridge lines ups and downs toward Trukee we tried to keep the breaks to a minimum with the understanding that at the road was a ski lodge offering free beer to hikers. Neither of us care too much for beer typically but even what's normally unappetizing has a way of drawing excitement when 4 days into the backcountry. But walking through such a beautiful section I made sure to pause at times, finding presence.

At the ski lodge I got my beer as well as a sandwhich and milkshake, joining a large group of friends who arrived at the same time. Having not yet considered where we'd spend the night it was awesome to learn that we could stay at Crush's house. Crush was there for a few days off trail for a wedding and was happily hosting hikers throughout the house for the few days prior. We arrived in time for the last night. At the house we took showers, did laundry, and ate a super nice homemade dinner. Its always amazing to spend some time off trail with a group of hikers who collectively enjoy the small comforts of life. Even in the domestic chores required to bring the house back to order there was the same grace and camaraderie as I remember from Big Bear.
