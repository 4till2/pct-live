Walking the first 7 miles to grab ice cream and hot food was quick and easy. The next 15 we're some of the most challenging yet. With about 4000 feet of elevation gain my legs are tired. Yet I'm grateful for the exhaustion without pain. I rather enjoy the physical demand of large sustained climbs. Unlike the way down, ascents are each step a matter of will. It takes strength to proactively conquer a befronted challenge, while it's painful to forcibly respond to uncontrollable circumstances. I prefer the former. 

I arrived in camp later than anticipated for the lack of available level ground. Just before the sky reflected the last of light I set up, and made dinner. Alone among the bushes I dozed off for a night of absolute silence.
