We hiked many miles in an attempt to do a low mileage day before summiting Whitney. It turns out to be difficult. Filled with climbs, elevation weakness, and long water carries. By the time we arrive at the lake to camp I'm in a pretty poor mood. So I opt for the Thai Coconut Soup I've excitingly reserved for just this moment. I boil some water, pour it into the package, and wait the suggested 20 minutes. It's a disappointment. Sigh. I know sleep is needed so luckily we intend to start later than usual tomorrow. It'll get better. It always does.
