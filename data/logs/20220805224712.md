I began this adventure with consideration of gifting this experience to my 9 year old future self. To the kid who'd drift beyond the brick walls and teachers voice out the window cracked open, just past the cool fall breeze to a place wild, free and rich with adventure. That place is here. I only wish I could write a message in those passing clouds letting him know that some day he'd find his way. But maybe I do and that's how I got here. Today I feel proud. Even with all my doubts and insecurities. It's an emotional realization after years of choosing growth over comfort. I'm excited for the future unknowns.

I took an alternate route with Ibex for the waterfalls and rocky terrain. Though painful it was well worth the incredible views and frigid swim. Passing day hikers galore we arrive at the road leading into Cascade Locks and are immediately offered a ride to town from a visiting couple. What is this? Time and time again I've been intentionally leaving my destiny to chance and it works in unexpected and beautiful ways. In a conversation with a woman hiking alongside her children who I've last seen nearly 1900 miles ago I realize that these experiences are an opportunity to evolve my perspectives. To incorporate a newfound respect for living life beyond rational understanding. It's been on my mind for some weeks now given the numerous synchronistic experiences. Even before trail I asked myself what is this idea discussed in so many religions and philosophies encapsulated by words such as Divine, Intuition, or Universe. But as the etymology experience suggests, I've experimented with life at a fundamental level and found the beginnings of an answer which language struggles to capture. Ever a skeptic at heart I will continue to explore this idea with an open mind. I expect nothing and will likely find everything.

Im sleeping beside the Columbia River on the border between Oregon and Washington. There are lots of familiar faces, and plenty new. Obviously Oregon went in unexpected ways but the few days here have been incredibly impactful nonetheless. Everyone I meet has their own stories related to the challenges of this  past week. It's brought an even further sense of unity between hikers. Tomorrow I cross by foot into Washington. Hell frikin yeah.
