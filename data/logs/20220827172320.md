It's been 20 days since last journaling. Immediately after getting back on trail from Trout Lake I lost my phone. Having spent the day hanging out with C-Dog, Slay, Two Tone, and Rapunzel, resupplying, eating, and playing, we hitched the 25 minutes back to trail in the back of a pickup truck. Moments later my phone fell from my pocket while skipping in an event only understood by the moment. By the time I noticed there was a 5 mile gap where it may have fallen. I ran back a few looking under every blowdown for a sign of it, to no avail. The next day I had family log in to my computer back home and use find my iPhone to get the coordinates. Luckily it was within service and I hadn't yet turned on airplane mode (an anomaly). After getting the location I asked a southbound hiker to look for it there and if found please ship it to me at the next town. They found it and did as promised, though in the confusion it was headed to C-Dogs house in Tennessee. When I learned about this at White Pass I rerouted the delivery to Cascade Locks, where I had already considered returning to for PCT Days the next week. 

A lot has happened in the last 20 days that will live mostly in memory, unjournaled. Since Trout Lake I hiked with Two Tone and Rapunzel. It was nice to have consistent companionship again. Together we went to PCT Days, getting picked up by Rapunzel's trail friend Sherpa. Cascade Locks was a true party, with friends from all over trail consolidating in one place. Only on trail can a lifetime of experiences fit into the 24 hour's I spent there. Overflowing with new memories and emotions Two Tone and I returned to Snoqualmie Pass while Rapunzel stayed behind reunited with old friends. We continue to hike together up to the border. The trail at this point is rich with emotion as things begin to wrap up. Each person at this point has gone through a similar journey of struggle and accomplishment. The sense of closure is feeling natural as I quickly approach the northern terminus. I'm prepared to transition to the post trail life, more so than just a few weeks ago. Whatever comes next I know will carry the lessons I've learned here. One of those being; what I pursue matters less than how I pursue it. Put in other words; it's the journey that counts, and virtue is found with intention.
