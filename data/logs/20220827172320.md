After having lost my phone i havent been journaling which in a way has been a relief. My phone feel from my pocket while skipping along trail just after returning from Trout Lake. I ran back looking for it but could not find it. The next day I had family log in to my computer and use find my iPhone to get the coordinates. Luckily it was within service and I hadn't yet turned on airplane mode (an anomaly). After getting the location I asked a southbound hiker to look for it there and if found please ship it to me at the next town. They found it and did as promised. Though I didn't intent to go to PCT Days i now had to go pick up my phone in Cascade Locks either way. Im happy I did. It was great to catch up with friends from all over trail. The ride there and back was easy enough. Since Trout Lake I've been hiking with Two Tone and Repunzel, and continue to hike with Two Tone until the border. Things on trail have been feeling right again after a few days of odd feelings. The sense of closure is feeling natural as I quickly approach the northern terminus. I feel prepared to transition to the post trail life, more so than I did just a few weeks ago. Whatever comes next I know will carry the lessons I've learned here. One of those being it matters less what I'm doing than how I do it. I value living life fully and with intention, be that in my work or adventures.
