The day began with ideal hiking weather.  Barely any clouds in the sky, and even the few present stood unthreatening. I took the bus from bishop to independence and a hitch from there to the trail head. Climbing back over Kearsarge Pass was less difficult than anticipated. Yet tired from the last few nights of crashing on the hostel couch I took a quick unexpected nap on a rock a little ways down the other side. Better rested I continued forward toward Rae Lakes. The current section of 120 or so miles until Mammoth is supposed to be one of the most beautiful sections on the PCT. Yet this beauty comes with a price. A pass per day. For the next seven days I will be climbing at least one pass. Today I climbed two. The second, Glen Pass was immensely beautiful in ways I have never experienced. It didn't hurt that just before reaching it a storm rolled in dramatically dropping hail. At first I tried to wait the storm out but after some time I grew impatient and decided to give it a go. Along the way we're lakes with water blue enough to make any miniature golf course jealous. Then after a near vertical climb up, the peak did not disappoint. The mountains here are as mountain like as it gets. Jagged inclines and perfectly shadowed edges lead the eye up toward sharp snow covered peaks. Down below are turquoise lakes among a network of streams feeding the valleys fresh green grass and wild flowers. Today the scene was painted extra dramatically with dark gray clouds dropping white balls of hail. I'm camping at Rae Lakes im my tent and feel a sense of peace here. I'm feeling more and more conflicted with the desire to be still and move forward. Scenes like this are inspiring to spend time in, yet to do so for too long could compromise the overall trip. At least for now I think I'll stop counting miles, knowing to at least cross one pass per day.
