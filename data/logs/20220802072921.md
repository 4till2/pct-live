I left our Airbnb to pickup some ingredients for breakfast then not again until walking Stacy out after dinner in the evening. Finding comfort on the couch and air conditioning was what I needed this zero to properly rest up. So when the others left to float down the river I put my feet up and watched a movie. It's been a good while since taking a "homestyle" zero, lounging in a living room, eating home cooked meals. Tomorrow we go back to trail just 75 miles from the Washington border. Today we eat well and move a little.
