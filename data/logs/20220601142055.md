Yesterday's early start, followed by a night of broken sleep, paired with todays heat, has me exhausted. Sitting in Agua Dulce's Mexican restaurant has me stuffed and in dire need of some good rest. Yet even still I'd prefer to be in the wild and out of town. A good sign.

With all the confusion about the possible fire closure we had arranged for Jerry the security guard from the KOA to give rides past. Only after the first shift departed did we confirm that it was indeed open, despite the previous report. Even so the day is far to hot to hike so I rested in town until evening before taking a few more miles of hills. Surprisingly I felt strong and rejuvenated climbing this evening, making good time on the 8 mile ascent.
