I think I finally figured out why it is so important for me to be able to take routes off trail. For someone looking in it may seem a silly idea that to walk 20 miles on a path "off trail" in lieu of 25 miles of path "on trail" is any less significant, however there exists a culture of purity that becomes apparent rather quickly and can easily overpower what one brought as their own personal objectives. Self determination and accountability toward someone else's goals. Ideas that I respect quite immensely however only when authentic to oneself. If you ask anybody here most will reveal a grander purpose for being on trail beyond reaching Canada. I came for a sense of simplicity, liberty, and adventure. Each of those require living in the moment, beyond constraints, responsive to circumstance and environment, unrestricted by the ideas rules or objectives of others. A true adventure has no pre-defined path nor right or wrong direction. So the trail continues to be a facilitator, a space for deep thought, and an environment to experiment with life. Sometimes the trail leads to another and that's ok. It's not enough to just be free in one's thoughts, we must also be free in our actions. So the appearance of cowardice or cheating, might actually just be the independent act of doing something not familiar by others. It isn't lost on me that most of my side adventures are surface level easier physically, however the mental challenge taking the unknown or even the physical one taking a less traveled path reinforces my ability to navigate the world independently with confidence.

At the junction with the road I turned right to take the 19 mile road walk into town. Its long, tough, and boring. Perfect for changing things up. In the boredom and pain I remind myself that all previous experiences suggest that so long as I keep walking I'll arrive as expected. Yet in the moment it's a seemingly impossible 19 miles left on the map. Time to zone out and walk.

Nine miles before town I begin throwing my thumb at passing cars. The asphalt is just really hurting my feet. Seven miles out a car pulls over to offer a hitch. A mother and daughter are returning from a night camping and are happy to drive me to town, feeding me snacks along the way. Trout Lake is flush with unfamiliar hikers. Overwhelmed I settle into the cafe for a fresh meal. Not long after I'm sitting with new friends. We're the last ones to leave after closing. Heading toward camp I bump into Slay and C-Dog who've just arrived. We sit and chat for a while before continuing on to camp for the night.
