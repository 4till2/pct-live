I just walked 30 miles through the high Sierras in one day. Wow do my feet hurt. This morning upon waking I decided I'd try to reach the arbitrary milestone of hiking 30 miles in one day. Many people attempt this in the desert or flats of Oregon, yet I figured if I can do it here in one of the more technical parts of the trail I am prepared for anything that the trail throws my way. With the onset of my "trail legs" I figured it a good time to test my limits. I genuinely wasn't sure if I'd make it. Only at mile 27 did I commit without a doubt. And it was the longest 3 miles of my life. Its less so about the number thirty and more so about the empowerment of reaching a desired goal. During the thirteen hours it took to hike thirty miles I traversed an awe inspiring world of beauty and felt nearly every emotion while doing so. I hiked through dense woods with massive ancient sequoias, marched across meadows of flowing grass, climbed up and over snow capped mountains, swam in a frigid glacier lake, hopped across countless streams, wadded across rivers, swatted at hundreds of blood thirsty mosquitoes, and stood feet away from feeding deer. Today began with the question, "can I hike 30 miles through the sierras and what would it feel like to try?". It ends with the answer yes and it hurts good. 

Tomorrow I can reach Mammoth a day ahead of schedule if I hike 26 miles. That too will be tough, possibly even more so after exhausting my body today. To be determined if I do.
