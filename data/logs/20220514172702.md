Beginning the day with Skunk Slayer brought joyful familiarity. We hiked a few miles and then spent time under a shading rock as one might spend some hours visiting an old friend in their city flat. Snacks, drinks, and good conversation. When she departed back to the car I remained for a midday nap. Spending the day leasurely reminds me of what's important here; the moments between the mile markers.

In the heat of the day I journeyed onward taking time to enjoy the process. Even the intensity of the climbs are more enjoyable when one step matters more than all. 

At the top of the ridge is where I sit now grasping for the means to comprehend my surroundings. I don't mind the flies harasong the nostrils breathing deep the sweet smell of nearby lavender flowers. In the air is the constant sound of birds singing to one another across the hills. Far below on opposite sides are tremendous valleys. Each expanding far beyond the eyes view, filled with fractals of itself like ocean waves. One is brown and the other green. My place a damn in the sky, determining who drinks and who does not. Damn or not beauty remains indifferent.

In all this expansiveness it's impossible to not feel the raw reality of existence. Calm, joy, sadness, companionship, and loneliness, all show themself here. So I try to take a photo then a video in a dire attempt to capture and study this moment. But of course it fails as will these words. The only hope is to listen to the language spoken by Nature without judgment, or imposition . Maybe then I can understand what she says.
