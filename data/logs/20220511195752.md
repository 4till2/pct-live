The days physical challenge was immense with new and old pains shouting for my attention alike. Yet mentally I found a clear and determined mind that brought me just shy of mile 142, for a 22 mile day. 

The first seven miles went easily, delivering me to Miles Place. Post apocalyptic is the only way to describe the environment there. As a water cache and charge up point most everyone stops at this trail angles property just a few feet off trail. Surrounding the property are old painted cars, rusting appliances, and the appropriate amount of signs and fences.

After leaving Mikes Place the familiar pains where muted by something new in my left hip. The rest of the day would become a mentally demanding exercise of will to get myself the 15 or so miles further I had anticipated to hike that day, in order to get myself to Idyllwild by Thursday. For this I turned to the stoic philosophy of Epictetus as inspiration. It's been a while since reading philosophy and I particularly enjoyed the chosen selections read by A.A Long in How to Be Free. Stoicism has always resonated as a philosophy well grounded in practicality. Today I got to realize this. 

Tonight I camp alone for the first time this trip. Tomorrow I reach Idyllwild where fresh food, new shoes and hopefully alleviation await.
