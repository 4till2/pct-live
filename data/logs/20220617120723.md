I enjoyed hiking today. At least for some time. We left camp beside the lake well into the morning allowing for a relaxed and slow wake up. I chose to hike alone at a slower pace. At one point it dawns on me that I am enjoying the hike. Not too heavy of a pack, and cool weather keep it comfortable while my leisurely pace remains effortless. It only took 750 miles. And lasts about 5. I note to myself that I'll need to do some slower backpack trips when this one wraps up. But for now I have a different purpose. I suppose. Anyway the weather is getting colder and the clouds uninviting so it's best if I get a move on.

Our campsite is beside a grand meadow a few miles shy of Mt. Whitney. There's a good stream nearby and lots of hikers who know it. It's probably the most populated campsite I've stayed at. Word travels fast among hikers and we hear word that a ranger came by to warn people of cold conditions atop Whitney, resulting in two hypothermic cases this morning. We quickly adjust our plans of a sunrise summit to early morning to avoid near zero temperatures. I'm glad about that decision.
