Two miles in we took a long breakfast at the parking lot. Got some trail magic from day hikers who as self proclaimed moms shared some of their days goodies. The next section was beautiful and challenging. Unbelievable wildflowers painted the trail in a multitude of colors and scents. From bright purple to deep yellow the ridge line trail is nothing short of a spectacle. Once back in the trees Benji and I took a near 4 hour lunch break in the shade beside a stream. My longest lunch by a long shot. Slowing down leaves far more room for conversation and relaxation but also once accepted, ease of mind. I did the next 6 miles with seemingly little effort despite it being a three thousand foot incline. At the top was a ski lift station seen uniquely without snow. We hiked only a mile further to camp 12 miles from Donner Pass Road where we complete this stretch tomorrow. It's nice to hike with someone so familiar, in an unfamiliar way.
