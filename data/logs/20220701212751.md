Slow slow day yet surprisingly made it 15 miles. Woke at 7 naturally. Repacked my food eating a bunch and discarding some. Hiked slowly and with frequent breaks. It was like day two all over again. Finally after a late lunch and rest did things began to pick up. I tried to fish for dinner but couldn't catch anything. I'll need to put an effort in during mid day while more energized.
