A shorter day hiking into the town of  Wrightwood for rest, hot food, and a resupply. After a few hours there I left Oceans 11 behind to get back on trail. Though enticed by the prospect of staying the night, I feel as if I just got my momentum going after Big Bear and don't want to spend to long off trail just yet. So as for now I'm hiking my first section truly solo. Its more comforting to know they're behind me than ahead, leaving a strong possibility of seeing them again. I feel ready to experiment more with solitude on trail, having grown into a "thru-hiker" as a part of a group.
