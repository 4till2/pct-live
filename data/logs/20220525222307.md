As per my commitment with David we did our 300 push-ups for 300 miles. 

At many points along the trail I had access to the river and its foliages shade. I took the days siesta at one particular pool even more paradise like than the others. Further down trail I stopped for a dip in the natural hot spring where I ate dinner before departing for a few more miles of night hiking. Exhausted, Neinke and I stopped a mile short of the damn at a sketchy campspot, after failing to find anything more suitable for many miles. A few moments of stargazing later and the days mileage took me for the night.
