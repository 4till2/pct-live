It's not every day that I hike 9 miles before 7:30 am, but today was one of those days. At the road junction I waited just a few minutes before Scott showed up in his pickup to give me a lift. Turns out he manages the integral water caches at 617 and 630 which he had just replaced as a precautionionary measure to the outbreak of on trail illnesses. We had some nice chats and he dropped me at a diner in the center of Lake Isabella. Apparently he lives in DC but spends the hiking season out here doing angel work, managing caches and providing lifts. And yet he refused my donation.

After a full breakfast at the diner I crossed the street to the dentist office to see if they might squeeze me in sooner. While waiting an older gentleman entered the waiting room and after the receptionist informed him about my hiking trip he shared that he had hiked the PCT as a 12 year old Boy Scout in the late 50's. Just a few moments after finishing the administrative tasks I was called back. The dentist filled the missing cavity and repaired another nearby for $42 after insurance. Apparently interested in the hike and my doing so in Walmart sandals, she called her boyfriend Jess to come by and chat shoes with me, since he'd been in the business. And that's what we did. Back in the waiting room we discussed shoe strategies and he tried his best to help me find a store nearby. As we decided a outdoor store up the road in Kernville was the best option the dentist came out from the back dressed in street clothes informing us that id be joining them for lunch. So in a unique moment I was treated to delicious Mexican food by my dentist and her boyfriend. We sat for a while in discussion. I learned about their relationships, children, dreams, and current circumstances. They learned about the struggles, lessons, motivations, and experience of being on trail. After this Jess dropped his girlfriend back at her office and drove me up to Kernville.

I stayed in the adventures store for much of the rest of the day. Though they had one pair of shoes that were promising I was afraid to pay yet another $150 for the wrong shoe. So wighour a means to truly try and possibly return, I didn't purchase them. Nonetheless the employees where kind and I spent time chatting with them and hanging around their air conditioned store. At some point per their suggestion I ventured through the heat to a lodge nearby to seek accommodations. An hour later and I was back without success. Apparently the director the local PCTA would be coming by soon and I thought to inquire with him for lodging ideas, and to dig deeper into the water crisis that was quickly becoming a serious matter. In contact with friends still in Tehachepi it was apparent the news of hikers getting sick on the stretch to Walker Pass was complicating many hikers plans, especially without having any concrete info. Even when I asked the local rangers for any suggestions they had little to offer. As it turns out neither did the PCTA guy. About the water or lodging. At least my time waiting for him wasnt a complete waste of time since the store manager had gifted me some ice cream during the wait. But with the day closing up Inneeded to get some dinner and make a plan for the night. 

Across the street at the pizza shop I charged up my electronics, made some phones calls, and ordered a pizza. A pizza and a half was delivered since the kitchen had apparently botched the order. I didnt know the difference but appreciated the extra. After eating I packed back across the street to a campground beside the river. The campground was more a paid parking lot than campground but bring in for I let myself in and walked beyond the rows of cars into the brush. There I camped incognito. Tomorrow I'll make my way to Inyokern to see about picking up some shoes I shipped to the post office.
