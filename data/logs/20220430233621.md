> A banana gifted at breakfast led to a day of friendships, conversations, jokes, and adventures.

In the kitchen this morning Monica from Spain offered me a banana in response to my comment on her breakfast arrangement. This led to our eating together and my invitation for her and a nearby German girl, Leia, to join our excursions for the day. 

Before we left I noticed someone who appeared to be with all the gear for a big hike. Upon inquiry I learned Neinke is too heading up the PCT this season. So we gave her a ride to Scout and Frodos (PCT hosts), presumably offering her her first bit of trail magic. While there I inquired about staying with them as well, so that I can meet other hikers and ease my way on to trail. At first there was a hestitance due to my lack of booster but we settled on a rapid test upon arrival. So tomorrow evening I camp in their backyard among other hikers departing early Monday morning for the trail. 

From there Alfston, Hiren, Monica, and Lea and I spent a few minutes at the Mall picking up some food and clothes before heading for the La Jolla beach. At the pressure of my friends I got a pair of properly fitting lightweight pants for the trail. Apparently not good enough. Maybe tomorrow I'll try again wherever we go for the last of my goods. 

The cold ocean water always reminds me of something. This time it was how simultaneously frightening yet appealing I find the power in each wave. For the next few hours we bathed in all that is La Jolla Beach. Steep rocks, lead to a beach wide with sand. Clothing optional rules leave many without, and just enough discomfort for the rest of us to notice. 

We got a real kick out of watching a much older gentleman brazenly flirt with an attractive young model, both in the nude, rather successful. We took turns hypothesizing about the escalating circumstance before us. With questions unanswered a brave member of our watch party approached the man (once alone again) to inquire for some explanation. He didn't provide much in terms of wisdom. 

Back at the hostel we cleaned up and reconvened for dinner. With our small crew we spent until closing at a Mexican restaurant in conversation. High in spirits some went back out for the night life and others, myself included, stayed back for a more quite evening.
