These legs carried me 1000 miles. Thats nuts. I don't really understand what that means. I can comprehend 100 or even 300 miles but 1000 not so much even though its past. Well it's a cool idea but without much meaning in itself. The last two months of individual experiences are so rich I'd be a fool to think this arbitrary milestone holds any more importance than any other. A reminder that goals and milestones should serve to facilitate a desired journey more than a destination. It's easy to forget in the day to day of hiking that Canada is a destination enabling the day to day experience of hiking. So here's to 1000 miles of individually important experiences, and to 1600 more!
