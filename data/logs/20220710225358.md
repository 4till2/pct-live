Looking back to my own start on trail I realize that Benji will be working harder than many in a possibly more challenging terrain, but he understood this when coming out and seems to appreciate the challenge. A couple miles after getting back on trail, town burritos still in our bellies, we swam in what's been one of the nicer trail lakes, Lake Aloha. Then we hiked 2 miles on the wrong trail missing the junction while distracted by conversation with a farmer from Oregon who didn't seem too pleased by this discovery. Either way we made it to the top of the pass just as darkness was settling in, safe from the bears but not mosquitoes. It's really nice to be hiking with someone so familiar as it is to be influenced by some fresh perspective and appreciation.
