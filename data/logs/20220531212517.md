I've been meeting lot's of new people in the absence of my regular bubble. Knee pain was flairing up during todays super hot and long day. After having arrived at the KOA I did laundry, showered and ate a dinner of microwave food. There's word of a trail closure due to fire that well have to get a ride past tomorrow.
