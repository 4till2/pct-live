A trippy day beside a more remote lake found a mile from last nights camp. We did little physical activity but lots mentally. Lounging in the shade I had lots of time to observe and reflect more deeply than usual. I realize I've grown nostalgic for the early days of trail and am more and more seeing the experience of thru hiking as a grand metaphor for life. 

Begin as a child finish as nostalgic adult

To hike is to live with full intentionality
