Todays hiking was nice but like most others out here im looking forward to the completion of the desert. Even still there was only a couple miles of extreme heat before a social siesta. I didnt wear my knee brace for the first time in a few days and am thankfully without trouble. I'm optimistic that soon the knee pain will be a thing of distant memory. Possibly out of irresponsible excitement I hiked the last 7 miles of the day at my fastest rate, working to keep up with Slay's natural pace. Even with a quick pause to meet Bowser the toad lizard.

Today marks the completion of one month of hiking! Tomorrow I reach 500 miles. That's significantly more time and miles than I've previously hiked collectively. Jeez.
