One of the best hiking days yet. I woke early after a somewhat restless night frightened by the mosquitoes lurking above my face, to try and get to Kennedy Meadows Resort by midday. After a few miles of easy hiking I stopped for a big breakfast, finishing up what food I had left. Soon there after was a massive climb along a beautiful barren mountainside reminiscent of the desert which in an an odd and unexpected way I miss. Although tough I really do enjoy the intensity of these strenuous efforts. It's the only time while hiking where I feel fully engaged. Mind and body.  From the top was a long but extremely pretty and dynamic ways to the road. During this stretch were some sketchy snow patches where crampons would have been nice. A few miles before reaching the road I noticed Afterparty talking on the phone so I switched on my service to learn that Devorah had a baby boy three days ago! I'm truly disconnected. 

It was really nice to see familiar faces at Kennedy Meadows Resort after so long alone in the wilderness. But I didn't stay long. After a few frozen burritos, an ice cream, laundry, and charging up, I left to be back on trail less than 4 hours after catching a hitch out. Already having walked 16 miles today I figured I'd put in another 5 or so before feeling finished. But it turns out I had energy for more. At times practically running I managed another 12 miles before dark. I thought I might catch up with some friends I know are nearby but they must be a few miles ahead. Tomorrow I should reach them. It's tough knowing that there are people both ahead and behind I'd love to be with, requiring me to either speed up or slow down, either way a sacrifice. At least for now I'll speed up since Benji meets me in Lake Tahoe in four days. Another nice bit of news I learned today.
