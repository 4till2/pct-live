Listening to the hobbit while walking through these parts has me feeling as if I'm on an otherworldly adventure of my own. True there may be no dwarves, or elves, but magic is everywhere. From the trail angels delivering food water and much needed transportation, to the spectacular sunsets that would surly bring envy to the eyes of Mr. Disney. Each morning I wake to the chirping of birds singing praise to another rising sun. Even in the burnt remainders of fallen trees there lies a story of life's chaotic ways. I now know why John Muir and friends had so much to say and I'm afraid that no words not even theirs can do justice to the raw reality of it all. The colors, sounds, and smells that expand far beyond my imagination, let alone capacity to comprehend. And this is just the external experience.

Internally there's an entire other tale to be told. One of trial, pain, and discomfort. One of discovery, growth, and evolution. Of socialization, community, and communication. I don't know yet know how this story unfolds but as I've reflected before, it's already a pretty damn interesting one.

With 21 miles to go before 5 pm I began my days journey before the sun did hers. Making pretty good progress by the 11th mile, I foolishly attempted to test my maximum speed, resulting in a 12 minute mile and a throbbing knee. After taking breakfast and some advil there, I continued forward, hobbling along with occasional outbursts of self directed explicative's. It was already a very long day by the time 10 o'clock came around with the days blessings of elaborate heat. Somehow I made it up the last big hill before the road to Big Bear City and was met with Bosco and his dog who immediately asked if I'd need a ride to town and turning himself around for the mile walk back to where he had parked. Lost in discussion of his hobby of flying hot air balloons, we walked straight past the monument announcing the 10% completion point. 

Before 4 pm I'm sitting on Dmitry's couch, comfortably showered, catching up with a friend who I see too infrequently. Together we run a few errands, clearing the next few days of any necessary obligations. I hope the time off will be enough to heal the minor injuries endured before heading back to trail Monday. I'm grateful to be here.
