Sleep matters. Last nights early night helped clear my mind and bring a fresh perspective. The walk into Toulmme Meadows was pleasant. There I got some breakfast and coffee. Then I lightened my load. It made a huge difference. The day was still somewhat more challenging than before Mammoth but much better than just days prior. Lesson being, sleep.
