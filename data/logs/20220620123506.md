Yay zero. I thought I might head back to trail with the others but will not. Boogie, Prarie Dog, Brightside, and McMansion head back, leaving Anna, Alchemist, and I stay back considering a later return. Later we decide to stay another night. Perfect. We borrowed some bikes and did the rest of the chores with leisure. Not exactly a relaxing day after doing laundry, shopping, packing, repacking, and phone calls but I ate well, had fun, and tomorrow morning will be easy. I'll catch up on journaling then too.
