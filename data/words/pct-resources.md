Some resources I collected while researching thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. Some are good for pre trip others I intend
to use on trail.

## Pre Trail
**General Info**
- [Official PCT site](https://www.pcta.org)
- [Pct Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificCrestTrail/)

**Maps**
- [Google Map Version](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1UtogyvQzegPXZYLARMCTwckZTRxIOOLf&ll=41.34499145337969%2C-119.83531350000001&z=5)
- [PCTA Interactive Map](https://arcg.is/1vT1ui0) (Lots of layers to play around with)
  
**Gps Data and Trail Notes**
I used these to learn more about what lies ahead. Practically all apps and maps I came across reference the "Halfmile" field data.
- [Halfmile GPX data](https://pctmap.net/gps/)
- [Halfmile Trail Notes](https://pctmap.net/trail-notes/)
- [Awesome collection of Map layers](https://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner%3A%22gkeily_PCTA%22&restrict=false&sortOrder=desc&sortField=relevance#content)

**Planning**
- [Gear, Surveys, Blog](https://www.halfwayanywhere.com/pacific-crest-trail/) (Pretty sweet blog run by a guy named Mac)
- [pctplanner.com](https://pctplanner.com) (I haven't actually tried this site.)
- [Hiker Food Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1DsLpp9lEXGZTKWVMyA3eNTeN4NHTSGGAwln1yoWI0Cw/htmlview#) (from the [GearSkeptic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflIoVkAjQnyAwDKFmhRDDw) on YouTube)

## On Trail
**Getting to the trail**
- [Shuttle Service](https://pctsouthernterminusshuttle.com/https/book-your-ride)

**Water Report**
A community led initiative to track the water status along the trail.
- [https://pctwater.com](https://pctwater.com)
- [Google Map Version](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1UtogyvQzegPXZYLARMCTwckZTRxIOOLf&ll=41.34499145337969%2C-119.83531350000001&z=5)
- [Android App (experimental)](https://github.com/jithware/mappoff)

**Mapping**
I will use a mix of custom map printouts, and digital data imports from the above resources.
- [Gaia App](https://www.gaiagps.com) (I imported the kml/gpx data from above resources)
- [FarOut](https://faroutguides.com) (Apparently very popular on trail for staying in the know)
- [Garmin](https://explore.garmin.com) (Using an InReach2 for waypoint tracking. Also with imported layers.)
- [All Halfmile Notes Minified](/resources/halfmiles-pct-notes-all-4-page.html) (I made this easy 2 page print out for lightweight and quick offline info.)
