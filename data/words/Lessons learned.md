There are many lessons I've been learning about myself in the world on my pacific crest trail hike so far. I've journaled many of them in the logs in blips found on the site others have yet to be documented. These are collection of some of the more Pct specific, technical lessons relevant to myself and others through hikers.
Three weeks in and this is what I've learned

Gear matters only so much as everything else is in place.
Repair your feet. Can you Calais them? Can you stretch them? The arch in Achilles' heel will hurt. 

You probably don't need that.
Your body will adjust, painfully, stress in your mind.
It's the miles between the markers the matter most.
If you find a group of people but they're moving at the wrong pace find your own your others out there.
 
Hiking sticks really help. 

I like anything trail because familiar patterns emerge sounds more recognizable ...

Blisters aren't as bad  has some of the other foot pain  that might be hard.
If you're not used to zero drop shoes a.k.a. ultra long peaks don't get them your feet will hurt and you can get injured. 


Everyone's got the other opinions understand them as anecdotes to their own experience not as truths. Fill your toolbox with other peoples knowledge and you can better find answers that suit you. Like everyone else you will form your own opinions and want to share them with others remember why and how you foreigners opinions to better understand them.

Taking a zero, day in the city, to heal or to explore is not any less a part of your hiking experience in the miles walked on trail itself

Worry less about reaching Canada then Living each day and it's entirety

- Adjusting your straps can be the difference between pain and comfort. 
- The same is true for shoe laces.
