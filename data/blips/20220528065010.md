This trip is a Declaration of Independence from fear.

Fear is the aversion of the unknown. 

Humans crave predictability. 

God is the answer to chaos. Science is the religion of predictability. 

Predictability is considered the ultimate. 

Maybe to live in harmony is to release oneself of the expectation of understanding what happens next. Could fear then be a decision? Death an accepted unknown? Life a momentary experience?
