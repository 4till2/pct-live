Im in tears. Not from the pain of walking on injured feet. Not from the struggle of being distant from home. Not from the impression made by the kindness of others. And not from the feeling of community felt dancing with Oceans 11. Im crying from the immense beauty surrounding me on all sides from sunrise to sunset. It's almost unfair to experience this much in this way in this amount of time.
